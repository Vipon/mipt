Your friend's files were encrypted by cryptor. You need to get a secret from a task.enc.

Fortunately you have an unencrypted copy of a description.txt. As well as
a source code of crypto software. I hope it helps you to find an ecryption
password and decrypt the task.enc.

Solution is a secret from the task file.

Good luck.
